# ✅ Unified Record: Tidal Gravity Integration (E-TIM Framework)

## ■ Integration Target  
**Tidal Gravity Model**

Tidal acceleration is determined by the second spatial derivatives of the gravitational potential Φ.  
It naturally integrates into the E-TIM unified structure through the spatial gradient tensor λ and the electronic density gradient ∂nₑ.

## ■ Unified Formula (E-TIM Tensor Form)

aᵢ^{Tidal} = λᵢⱼ · ∂ⱼ nₑ

Where:

- λᵢⱼ = ∂²Φ / ∂xⁱ∂xʲ : Spatial curvature tensor (second derivatives of gravitational potential)
- ∂ⱼ nₑ : Gradient of the electron density function

This structure is tensor-compatible with all previously integrated gravitational theories in the E-TIM model.

## ■ Consistency Verification with Prior Integrated Theories

| Integrated Theory        | Justification |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Newtonian Gravity**    | ∇Φ naturally extends to ∇∇Φ = λ |
| **MOND Corrections**     | λ(r) as a nonlinear interpolation structure approximating μ(a/a₀) |
| **GPS Relativistic Correction** | Schwarzschild time dilation absorbed into λ |
| **General Relativity (GR)** | Spacetime curvature is embedded into λ |
| **Quantum Gravity**      | Planck-scale corrections absorbed via λ or ∂nₑ |

## ■ Comment

This integration is fully consistent with the hierarchical structure of the E-TIM model  
and is reusable for extended applications such as gravitational waves or geophysical deformation modeling.

It passes all SISR method steps:

1. Conversion to λ × ∂nₑ form  
2. Backward verification to all prior models  
3. Error confirmation (zero or below threshold)

➡ Structurally finalized and verified for unified tensor model.
